## Overview

> The aim of this unit is to develop advanced and optimal software development techniques and to develop their professionalism and proficiency in the discipline area. 

- Advanced programming develops three separate themes
  - compilers
  - software optimization techniques
  - parallel software development

--

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Having completed this unit the student is expected to:
  
  1. design, implement and deploy applications on a parallel programming platform
  
  2. understand and apply optimization techniques to program design and implementation
  
  3. understand, design and implement a compiler using formal principles of language analysis.
